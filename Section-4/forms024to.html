<!--Forms: Container where all our input will go 
    action="" where data is going
    method="" what type of HTTP request is sent(get/post)
    
    <input type=""> goes inside forms
    type=text,date,color,file,checkbox etc.

    <button>Submit</button>
        <input type="Submit">
        both does the same thing

    in <form> if you dont specify action it will go where it was i.e refreshes the page 
    If method is not specified then by default a get request  
     <form action="http://google.com"  method="get">
    
    Once the form is submit the data is sent is sent along the reguest

    Labeltag is for visually impaired or blind and accedsssing form the screen reader software will read the label to them and also acts as a caption

    <label> has two syntax see below, one for username one for password

    Validator: tells us that what a password must have, is this a correct mail or not, thus field cannot be empty etc 
    Just add required which is by default true it wont let it be empty and is called presence validation 
     

    <input type="password" pattern=".{8,12}" required title="Enter 8 to 12 characters" placeholder="password" name="password">
